<div id=div1><h2>#5: Geometry Dash</h2>
<p>Geometry dash was released on August 13, 2013, by another swedish game developer, known simply as "RobTop." Geometry dash is somewhat of a rhythm game, but not done in the traditional sense. Instead, players simply tap repeatedly at the correct times to dodge spikes, jump, and avoid other obstacles. This may sound simple and quite straightforward, and at first it is, but it quickly gets much, much harder. Players are given the freedom to create there own levels and add there own songs using a music sharing website also created by RobTop called Newgrounds.The learning curve can be quite steep, but once you get into it its really quite fun. There is also a worldwide leader board between everyone who has an account so that you can see where you stand it terms of prestige. Geometry dash is also in second place for the longest a game took to update with an astounding six years, 11 months, and 3 days between version 2.1 and 2.2.</p></div>
