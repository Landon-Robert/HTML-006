<div id=div1><h2>#1: Minecraft</h2>
<p>Minecraft was released on May 17, 2009, and is the best selling game of all time with a whopping 300 million total copies sold by the start of 2023 (~3-4 per 100 people). Its first version was created in just 6 days by swedish game developer Markus 'Notch' Persson, who later founded Mojang AB to continue to develop his game. Minecraft's unique gameplay and variety of play styles is part of what makes it so popular. Whether you enjoy pvp, building your own designs, wilderness survival or modding the base game, Minecraft is a wonderful game that has something for everyone to enjoy. A school in Sweden even decided to include Minecraft as part of the curriculum, helping students learn about chemistry and many other subjects with Minecraft's education edition.</p></div>
