<div id=div1><h2>#4: Minecraft Dungeons</h2>
<p>Minecraft: Dungeons was released on May 26, 2020 by the Swedish game company Mojang studios. It's done in a Minecraft-like style but instead of being open world it focuses on the combat and exploration aspects of minecraft, with several exploarble and unique stages that you unlock by progressing through the game. It has great graphics, an interesting storyline, and in general was very well made. There is a leveling, xp and difficulty scaling, but its done in a way that allows you to unlock the vast majority of the content by simply playing through the game, instead of continuously grinding for xp and better weapons/armor.</p></div>
