<div id=div1><h2>#2: TLOZ: TOTK and BOTW</h2>
<p>I know that that was a lot of acronyms, but it wouldn't fit in the title otherwise. It stands for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom. Botw was released on March 3rd, 2017 by Nintendo. It's amazing graphics and awesome open world gameplay style won it several awards such as best game of the year and make it an extremely popular switch game. It's unique playstyle allows players the choice to follow the storyline or simply explore and do whatever they want. Tears of the Kingdom is basically a massive DLC for botw (although being its own seperate game), took the gameplay a step further by adding several layers to the map, small scale vehicle construction, and several new abilities for link. Out of all the pricey switch games, breath of the wild and tears of the kingdom are definitely some of the best value.</p></div>
